# Data Processing Project

This project demonstrates a robust data processing pipeline using Python with Pandas, integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. It processes an Excel data file, performs transformations, and publishes the results as a JSON artifact via GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

*   `execute.py`: The core Python script responsible for reading, processing, and outputting data.
*   `data.xlsx`: The input Excel file containing raw data.
*   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow definition for CI/CD.
*   `data.csv`: An intermediate CSV file generated during the CI process from `data.xlsx`. (Not committed directly to the repository, but generated by CI).
*   `result.json`: The final processed data output in JSON format. (Not committed to the repository, but generated and published by CI).
*   `index.html`: A simple, responsive web page to serve as a front-end or dashboard overview, styled with Tailwind CSS.
*   `LICENSE`: The MIT License detailing the terms of use for this project.

## Setup and Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.11+ and the following libraries:

*   `pandas==2.3`
*   `openpyxl` (for reading `.xlsx` files)
*   `ruff` (for code linting)

To install dependencies locally:

```bash
pip install pandas==2.3 openpyxl ruff
```

## `execute.py` - Data Processing Script

The `execute.py` script performs the following operations:

1.  Reads data from `data.xlsx` using Pandas.
2.  Ensures the 'Value' column is numeric, handling potential non-numeric entries by coercing them to `NaN` and then dropping rows with `NaN` in this critical column. This addresses a non-trivial error where arithmetic operations might fail on mixed-type data.
3.  Calculates a 'DoubledValue' by multiplying the 'Value' column by two.
4.  Determines if the 'DoubledValue' is even, storing the result in an 'IsEven' column.
5.  Outputs the processed data as a JSON array of records to standard output, with indentation for readability.

**Example `data.xlsx` structure (hypothetical):**

| ID    | Name    | Value |
| :---- | :------ | :---- |
| 1     | Alpha   | 10    |
| 2     | Beta    | 15    |
| 3     | Gamma   | Text  |
| 4     | Delta   | 20.5  |

**Expected `result.json` structure (example):**

```json
[
    {
        "ID": 1,
        "Name": "Alpha",
        "Value": 10.0,
        "DoubledValue": 20.0,
        "IsEven": true
    },
    {
        "ID": 2,
        "Name": "Beta",
        "Value": 15.0,
        "DoubledValue": 30.0,
        "IsEven": true
    },
    {
        "ID": 4,
        "Name": "Delta",
        "Value": 20.5,
        "DoubledValue": 41.0,
        "IsEven": false
    }
]
```
*(Note: Row with 'Gamma' and 'Text' in 'Value' would be dropped due to numeric conversion error handling.)*

To run the script locally:

```bash
python execute.py > result.json
```

## GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the following steps on every `push` and `pull_request` to `main` or `master` branches:

1.  **Checkout repository**: Fetches the project code.
2.  **Set up Python**: Configures Python 3.11.
3.  **Install dependencies**: Installs `pandas==2.3`, `openpyxl`, and `ruff`.
4.  **Run Ruff Linter**: Checks the Python code for style and common errors, reporting results in the CI log.
5.  **Convert `data.xlsx` to `data.csv`**: Transforms the input Excel file into a CSV format. This `data.csv` is available in the CI runner's workspace for other steps, though `execute.py` currently reads `data.xlsx`. This step demonstrates data format flexibility in the pipeline.
6.  **Execute data processing script**: Runs `python execute.py`, redirecting its standard output to `result.json`.
7.  **Setup Pages**: Initializes GitHub Pages.
8.  **Upload artifact for GitHub Pages**: Uploads the generated `result.json` as an artifact.
9.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Publishes the `result.json` artifact to GitHub Pages, making it accessible publicly (e.g., at `your-org.github.io/your-repo/result.json`).

## `index.html` - Responsive Front-end

The `index.html` file provides a basic responsive single-page application built with Tailwind CSS. It serves as an entry point to the project, giving an overview and a link to the `result.json` output published via GitHub Pages.
